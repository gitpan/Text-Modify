			 ==================

NAME

    Text::Modify - interface for simple (and oo-style) text-file manipulation
    Text::Buffer - simple text buffer that supports basic edit functionality


DESCRIPTION

    Text::Modify uses rules to process a buffer of textlines. Text::Buffer
    is used for the required editing functionalities for the text to process.

	A set of simple rules is used with some advanced functionality, which
	should suit the most common use cases of text file modification tasks.


DEPENDENCIES

	No dependencies

TODO / WISHLIST

    Some ideas for improvements are:
    - Allow wildcard search and replaces
    - Better seperation of string and regex search and replaces
    	(suggested by Terence Brannon)
		e.g. $txt->replace( string => "foo", with => "bar")
    - Using buffer and stringops like in emacs (suggested by Terence Brannon)
